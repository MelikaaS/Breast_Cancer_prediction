# Predicting Breast Cancer with SVM and Logistic Regression

## Overview
This project utilizes the **Diagnostic Wisconsin Breast Cancer Database** to develop predictive models for breast cancer diagnosis. The dataset, provided by the University of Wisconsin, contains features derived from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast masses, with the goal of classifying tumors as benign or malignant.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to build and evaluate machine learning models capable of accurately predicting the diagnosis of breast cancer based on the provided features. The models used include **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** and **Logistic Regression**.

## Methodology
- **Data Exploration & Preprocessing**: Initial exploration to understand the distribution of data and preprocessing steps like label encoding.
- **Modeling**: Implementation of SVM and Logistic Regression models.
- **Evaluation**: Both models were evaluated using accuracy as the primary metric.

## Results
The Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy of **0.974**, which is within the range of the baseline model performance reported by UCI. This indicates that the models are highly effective in predicting breast cancer diagnosis, with performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of SVM and Logistic Regression in the domain of medical diagnosis. The high accuracy achieved suggests that these models could potentially assist in clinical settings, providing reliable predictions to support medical decision-making.

## Next Steps
- Explore other models like Random Forest and Neural Networks for potentially even better performance.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning to further optimize the models.
- Consider feature importance analysis to understand which factors most influence the predictions.
